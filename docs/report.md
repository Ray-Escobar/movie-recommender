# Report - Data Mining Project

## Introduction

The aim of this project was to create a movie recommendation system
based on a dataset containing the ratings of 6040 netflix users for
3706 movies. 

Our training data consisted of 3 datasets, containing data about *movies*
, *users*, as well as user *ratings* for those movies. The movies dataset contained the
*year* and the *title* for each movie; the *users* dataset contained the *gender*, *age*, and a
number encoding their *profession*; most importantly, the *ratings* dataset
contained the ratings some *users* gave to certain *movies*.

What we, essentially tried to achieve was to make use of the available data  predict future ratings as accurately as possible. 
Our approach was based on 2 directions, according to which we split our team:

* Collaborative Filtering - Cătălin Lupău
* Latent Factor Decomposition - Pietro Vigilanza
